Given a floor of dimensions 2 x W and tiles of dimensions 2 x 1, the task is to find the number of ways the floor can be tiled. 
A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e as 2 x 1 tile. Print the answer modulo 109+7.

Input:
W = 3
Output:
3
Explanation:
We need 3 tiles to tile the board
of size  2 x 3. 
We can tile in following ways:
1) Place all 3 tiles vertically. 
2) Place first tile vertically.
and remaining 2 tiles horizontally.
3) Place first 2 tiles horizontally
and remaining tiles vertically.

//code....

class Solution {
    static Long numberOfWays(int N) {
        Long[] fib = new Long[100005];
        fib[1]=1L;
        fib[2]=2L;
        for(int i=3;i<=N;i++)
         fib[i]= (fib[i-1]+fib[i-2])%1000000007;
         
         return fib[N];
    }
};
